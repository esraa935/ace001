  A computer programming language is a language used to write computer programs, which involves a computer 
performing some kind of computation or algorithm and possibly control external devices such as printers, disk 
drives, robots, and so on. For example, PostScript programs are frequently created by another program to control
 a computer printer or display. More generally, a programming language may describe computation on some, possibly 
 abstract, machine. It is generally accepted that a complete specification for a programming language includes a
 description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor for that language. In most practical contexts, a
 programming language involves a computer; consequently, programming languages are usually defined and studied this 
 way. Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interaction
 between people, while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.
    Programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining and manipulating data structures or controlling
	the flow of execution. The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is
	expressed by the abstraction principle. This principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the 
	programmer to make proper use of such abstractions.

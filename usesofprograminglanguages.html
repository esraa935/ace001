<p>Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computing field. Individual software
 projects commonly use five programming languages or more.

Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of 
precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and 
speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, 
figuratively speaking, computers "do exactly what they are told to do", and cannot "understand" what code 
the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's 
inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of 
control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the
 precision required for execution by using pseudocode, which interleaves natural language with code written in a
 programming language.
